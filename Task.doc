Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the internet?
As developers, understanding this can significantly enhance our grasp on web-based applications.
Here's a dive into some fundamental concepts about how the internet operates:

• 🔍 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁? 📹 https://youtu.be/Dxcc6ycZ73M

A global network of computers communicating through standardized protocols.
No single entity controls it, but it’s a collaboration of many networks.

• 📡 𝗪𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀, 𝗖𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗪𝗶-𝗙𝗶: 📹 https://youtu.be/ZhEf7e4kopM

Data moves through different mediums like Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables,
and wireless signals (radio waves). Each medium has its own pros and cons.

• 🌐 𝗜𝗣 𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗡𝗦: 📹 https://youtu.be/5o8CwafCxnU

The internet uses IP addresses to identify computers and DNS to translate domain names to IP addresses,
facilitating data transfer across the network.

• 📦 𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁𝘀, 𝗥𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: 📹 https://youtu.be/AYdF7b3nMto

Data is broken into packets that travel across various routes to reach their destination,
ensuring reliability and efficiency in data transfer.

• 🌍 𝗛𝗧𝗧𝗣 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗛𝗧𝗠𝗟: 📹 https://youtu.be/kBXQZMmiA4s
 
HTTP is the protocol used to transfer web pages over the internet,
and HTML is the standard language for creating web pages.

• 🔒 𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘀: 📹 https://youtu.be/ZghMPWGXexs
 
Cryptography, including SSL/TLS, ensures secure communication over the internet,
protecting data from unauthorized access.
 
• 🛡️ 𝗖𝘆𝗯𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲: 📹 https://youtu.be/AuYNXgO_f3Y
 
Cybersecurity involves measures to protect against online criminal activities.
Awareness of common cybercrimes is crucial for maintaining a secure internet environment.


Understanding these concepts provides a solid foundation for anyone working with web technologies.
It’s fascinating to see how every interaction on the internet involves a complex dance of protocols, data packets, and security measures.
